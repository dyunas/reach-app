      <h6>1. Acceptance of this Agreement</h6>
      <p>
        The Company provides an online marketplace connection, using web-based technology that connects you and other consumers, restaurants and/or other businesses and independent contractors (“Contractors”). The Company’s software permits consumers to place orders for food and/or other goods from various restaurants and businesses. Once such orders are made, the Company’s software notifies Contractors that a delivery opportunity is available and the software facilitates completion of the delivery to the consumer. The Company is not a restaurant, delivery service, or food preparation business.

You acknowledge and agree that Reach does not itself prepare food or offer delivery services and has no responsibility or liability for the acts or omissions of any Merchant or any Contractor.

Instead, DASHER shall be solely responsible for determining the most effective, efficient, and safe manner to perform the Contracted Services, including determining the manner of pickup, delivery, and route selection.</li>
        <li>As an independent business enterprise, DASHER retains the right to perform services (whether delivery services or other services) for others and to hold him/herself out to the general public as a separately established business.

        <li>REACH has no control over DASHER’s personal appearance.</li>

      </ol>

      <h6>VI. INSURANCE</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>DASHER agrees, as a condition of doing business with REACH, that during the term of this Agreement, DASHER will maintain current insurance, in amounts and of types required by law to provide the Contracted Services, at his/her own expense. DASHER acknowledges that failure to secure or maintain satisfactory insurance coverage shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and shall result in the termination of the Agreement and the loss of DASHER’s right to receive Delivery Opportunities.</li>
        <li>NOTIFICATION OF COVERAGE: DASHER agrees to deliver to REACH, upon request, current certificates of insurance as proof of coverage. DASHER agrees to provide updated certificates each time DASHER purchases, renews, or alters DASHER insurance coverage.</li>
        <li>WORKERS' COMPENSATION/OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE: DASHER acknowledges and understands that DASHER will not be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits through REACH and is instead responsible for maintaining DASHER’S own workers’ compensation insurance or occupational accident insurance.</li>
